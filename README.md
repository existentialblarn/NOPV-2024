# NOPV-2024
Code for summarizing Changes in Property Values (NOPV) for City Fiscal Year 2025. </br>
Data is uploaded here annually: https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/property/notice-of-property-value.page

## Background
Real Property taxes contribute 41 percent of all City Revenues (Tax and Miscellaneous). It is calculated by multiplying the property's taxable value by its class tax rate. The taxable value is calculated by applying the level of assessment, which is 6% (Tax Class 1) or 45% (all other classes), and the state law rules that limit how much the Assessed Value (AV) can increase from one year to the next, to DOF's estimated market value for each property, less any tax exemptions applied to the property. </br>

This python script summarizes the changes in property values, which has 5 public data updates between February and May of each year, by class and in aggregate. It contributes to a more accurate forecast of Real Property Tax revenues by providing implications about the ever-changing landscape of NYC properties.
